      Trades are categorized into three stages, Pending, Accepted, and Completed
      <br> We recommend that you stay in contact with users you have trades with by using the "Inbox" tab 
      <br> Before you accept or initiate a trade, you should confirm with the other user how you will exchange your cards and/or money
      <br> Note: Once a trade is accepted, both users have comitted to the other user that they will send them cards and/or money
      <br><br>
    <h5>Pending Trades</h5>
     If you initiated a trade, you may cancel the trade 
      <br> If you received a trade from another user, you may accept or decline the trade
      <br><br>
      <h5>Accepted Trades</h5>
      Once a trade is accepted both users should exchange their respective cards and/or money
      <br> Click your status in a trade to confirm that you have received the cards and/or money you expected
      <br> Once both users have confirmed, the trade is considered Completed
      <br><br>
    <h5>Completed Trades</h5>
      After a trade is confirmed by both users, you can rate the other user and leave a comment
      <br><br>
    <h3>How Do I Avoid Scams?</h3>
    1. We recommend that you exchange cards and/or money face-to-face
    <br> 2. For higher value cards, consider meeting at a local card shop to get the cards verified for authenticity
